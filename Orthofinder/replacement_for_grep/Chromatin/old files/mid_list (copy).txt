AT3G12810  	
Encodes a protein similar to ATP-dependent, chromatin-remodeling proteins of the ISWI and SWI2/SNF2 family. Genetic analyses suggest that this gene is involved in multiple flowering pathways. Mutations in PIE1 results in suppression of FLC-mediated delay of flowering and causes early flowering in noninductive photoperiods independently of FLC. PIE1 is required for expression of FLC in the shoot apex but not in the root.Along with ARP6 forms a complex to deposit modified histone H2A.Z at several loci within the genome. This modification alters the expression of the target genes (i.e. FLC, MAF4, MAF6).The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Other names: ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 6, ARP6, ATARP6, EARLY IN SHORT DAYS 1, ESD1, SUF3, SUPPRESSOR OF FRI 3
Encodes ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN6 (ARP6), a putative component of a chromatin-remodeling complex. Required for both histone acetylation and methylation of the FLC chromatin in Arabidopsis. Along with PIE1 forms a complex to deposit modified histone H2A.Z at several loci within the genome. This modification alters the expression of the target genes (i.e. FLC, MAF4, MAF6). Incorporation of this variant histone into chromatin mediates the ambient temperature response. Located at specific regions of the nuclear periphery. Expression throughout plants shown by in-situ and immunolocalization methods. Mutants show defects in fertility, leaf, flower and inflorescence development and shorter flowering times. ARP6 also is involved in globally controlling developmental responses to ambient temperature through incorporation of variant histone H2A.Z into chromatin.

Encodes a nuclear localized WD-repeat containing protein involved in negative regulation of knox gene expression via epigenetic mechanism of chromatin re-organization.

Interacts physically and genetically with AS1. Expressed in meristem and leaf primordia. Homozygous mutants are embryo lethal. Phenotype of cosuppressed lines is variable but show effects on leaf development similar to as1/as2.

Protein is similar to SWI2/SNF2 chromatin remodeling proteins. DDM1 is appears to act as a chromatin-remodeling ATPase involved in cytosine methylation in CG and non-CG contexts. Involved in gene silencing and maintenance of DNA methylation and histone methylation. Hypomethylation of many genomic regions occurs in ddm1 mutants, and can cause several phenotypic abnormalities, but some loci, such as BONSAI (At1g73177) can be hypermethylated in ddm1 mutants after several generations, leading to different phenotypes. DDM1 might be involved in establishing a heterochromain boundary. A line expressing an RNAi targeted against DDM1 shows some resistance to agrobacterium-mediated root transformation.
AT5G67100  	
Encodes the putative catalytic subunit of the DNA polymerase alpha. Interacts with genes involved in chromatin-mediated cellular memory. ICU2 genetically interacts with TERMINAL FLOWER2, the ortholog of HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 of animals and yeasts, and with the Polycomb group (PcG) gene CURLY LEAF. A number of regulatory genes were derepressed in the icu2-1 mutant, including genes associated with flowering time, floral meristem, and floral organ identity. Mutant has curled, involute leaves and causes early flowering.
