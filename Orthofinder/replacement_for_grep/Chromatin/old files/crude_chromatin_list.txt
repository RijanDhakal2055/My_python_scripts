AT1G04400  	
Other names: AT-PHH1, ATCRY2, CRY2, CRYPTOCHROME 2, FHA, PHH1
Blue light receptor mediating blue-light regulated cotyledon expansion and flowering time. Positive regulator of the flowering-time gene CONSTANS. This gene possesses a light-induced CNT2 N-terminal homodimerisation domain.Involved in blue-light induced stomatal opening. Involved in triggering chromatin decondensation. An 80-residue motif (NC80) is sufficient to confer CRY2's physiological function. It is proposed that the PHR domain and the C-terminal tail of the unphosphorylated CRY2 form a "closed" conformation to suppress the NC80 motif in the absence of light. In response to blue light, the C-terminal tail of CRY2 is phosphorylated and electrostatically repelled from the surface of the PHR domain to form an "open" conformation, resulting in derepression of the NC80 motif and signal transduction to trigger photomorphogenic responses. Cry2 phosphorylation and degradation both occur in the nucleus.The life-time of cry2 signaling state in situ (in planta) is about 16 min.

Other names: G-H2AX, GAMMA H2AX, GAMMA HISTONE VARIANT H2AX, GAMMA-H2AX, H2AXA, HISTONE H2A 5, HTA5
Encodes HTA5, a histone H2A protein. H2AX is a meiosis-specific isoform of histone H2A. Upon DSB formation, rapid accumulation of phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) occurs around the break site. H2AX foci accumulate in early G2. Immunolocalization studies in spread preparations of wild-type meiocytes at G2/early leptotene revealed the accumulation of numerous rather diffuse γ-H2AX foci throughout the chromatin. However, their accumulation is not contemporaneous with that of AtSPO11-1. At 3 h post-S, no γ-H2AX foci are detected. During the 3- to 5-h window when AtSPO11-1 foci rapidly disappear, there is an equally swift accumulation of γ-H2AX to a maximum of >50 diffuse foci. The level of γH2AX then remains constant for a further 13 h before undergoing a gradual decrease to 10–20 foci in the 18- to 24-h post-S period. By 30 h the foci have disappeared from the chromatin.

Western blot analysis and immunolabelling demonstrated a clear correlation between reductions in the level of AtARP4 expression and severity of the phenotypes.

Other names: IBM1, INCREASE IN BONSAI METHYLATION 1
IBM1 likely encodes a protein with histone H3mK9 demethylation activity. It may preferentially demethylate H3mK9 at low-copy loci to protect them from silencing by nearby heterochromatin by preventing the spread of cytosine methylation. BONSAI (At1g73177) is hypermethylated in ibm1 mutants. ibm1 mutants have morphological defects that become apparent at the F3 generation, including small narrow leaves, arrested flower development, and faulty pollen development. These phenotypes cannot result solely from the BONSAI hypermethylation. Aberrant phenotypes in ibm1 mutants in both DNA methylation and plant development can be suppressed by mutations in the KYP H3K9 methyltransferase or the CMT3 non CG-cytosine methylase.

AT3G12810  	
Other names:
Encodes a protein similar to ATP-dependent, chromatin-remodeling proteins of the ISWI and SWI2/SNF2 family. Genetic analyses suggest that this gene is involved in multiple flowering pathways. Mutations in PIE1 results in suppression of FLC-mediated delay of flowering and causes early flowering in noninductive photoperiods independently of FLC. PIE1 is required for expression of FLC in the shoot apex but not in the root.Along with ARP6 forms a complex to deposit modified histone H2A.Z at several loci within the genome. This modification alters the expression of the target genes (i.e. FLC, MAF4, MAF6).The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Other names: NRPD2A, NUCLEAR RNA POLYMERASE D2A, OCP1, OVEREXPRESSOR OF CATIONIC PEROXIDASE 1
This gene encodes the second largest, catalytic subunit of the nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (aka RNA polymerase D). The NRPD2 protein is found at nuclear foci that overlap or are adjacent to chromocentromeres but are not fully coincident with chromocentromeres. The loss of NRPD2 leads to the loss of cytosine methylation at pericentromeric 5S genes and AtSN1 retroelements but has no discernible effect on centromere repeat methylation. This suggests that Pol IV primarily affects facultative heterochromatin rather than constitutive heterochromatin.

Encodes a WD-40 repeat containing protein that functions in chromatin assembly as part of the CAF1 and FIE complex. Mutants exhibit parthenogenetic development that includes proliferation of unfertilized endosperm and embryos. In heterozygous plants 50% of embryos abort. Of the aborted embryos the early aborted class are homozygous and the later aborting lass are heterozygotes in which the defective allele is maternally transmitted. Other phenotypes include defects in ovule morphogenesis and organ initiation,as well as increased levels of heterochromatic DNA. MSI1 is needed for the transition to flowering. In Arabidopsis, the three CAF-1 subunits are encoded by FAS1, FAS2 and, most likely, MSI1, respectively. Mutations in FAS1 or FAS2 lead to increased frequency of homologous recombination and T-DNA integration in Arabidopsis. In the ovule, the MSI1 transcripts are accumulated at their highest level before fertilization and gradually decrease after fertilization. MSI is biallelically expressed, the paternall allele is expressed in the endosperm and embryo and is not imprinted. MSI1 forms a complex with RBR1 that is required for activation of the imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA. This activation is mediated by MSI1/RBR1 mediated repression of MET1.

Hypomethylation of many genomic regions occurs in ddm1 mutants, and can cause several phenotypic abnormalities, but some loci, such as BONSAI (At1g73177) can be hypermethylated in ddm1 mutants after several generations, leading to different phenotypes. DDM1 might be involved in establishing a heterochromain boundary. A line expressing an RNAi targeted against DDM1 shows some resistance to agrobacterium-mediated root transformation.
